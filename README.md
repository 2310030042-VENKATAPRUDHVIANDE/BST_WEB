# 🌳 Binary Search Tree Visualizer

An interactive web-based visualization tool for understanding Binary Search Tree (BST) operations in real time.

This project demonstrates core Data Structures concepts through a clean and modern UI with dynamic graphical rendering using HTML5 Canvas.

## 🧠 BST Operations Implemented

### Insert
Adds a node while maintaining BST properties.

### Delete
Handles:
- Leaf node removal
- Node with one child
- Node with two children (inorder successor method)

### Search
Returns whether a value exists in the tree.

### Inorder Traversal
Displays nodes in sorted order.

## 📊 Time Complexity

| Operation | Average | Worst Case |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Insert     | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Delete     | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Search     | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Traversal  | O(n)     | O(n) |

Worst case occurs when the tree becomes skewed.
